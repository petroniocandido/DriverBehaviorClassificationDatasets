Solution Approach

Aggressive driving includes speeding, sudden breaks and sudden left or right turns. All these events are reflected on accelerometer and gyroscope data. Therefore, knowing that almost everyone owns a smartphone nowadays which has a wide variety of sensors, we've designed a data collector application in android based on the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors.
